# Assignment 6.5: Roll-a-ball

- Create a stage in Unity with a camera and physics-based character controls.

- Implement coroutines in Unity.

Roll-a-ball is a classic first project in Unity to practice the basics in Unity.
Using the concepts examined in the program up to this point, create a simple square stage that a roll-a-ball controller can roll around in and create collectibles to pick up as the ball rolls around on the stage.

You should be able to produce the following:

- A simple square stage with a rolling ball and at least two collectibles
- The player should be able to use the W, A, S, D keys to move the ball forward, left, backwards, and right, respectively, at a constant speed
- As the ball rolls around, it should pick up the collectibles
- The camera should follow the player at a constant distance and elevation
